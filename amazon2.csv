With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960Â’s. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980Â’s. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches.

It was employed on long-distance express trains on the LNER and its successors, British Railways Eastern and North-Eastern Regions, notably on the 10am London to Edinburgh Flying Scotsman service after which it was named. In its career 4472 Flying Scotsman has covered more than 2,000,000 miles (3,200,000 km).Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue.

Plastic model kit. Manufacturers Description: William Stanier (1876-1965) was headhunted from the GWR to become Chief Mechanical Engineer of London, Midland and Scottish (LMS) Railways in 1932. With the support of the Chairman, Sir Josiah Stamp, Stanier is credited with modernising the LMS fleet of generally small steam locomotives with a larger, modern and more powerful array of designs. Soon after his appointment, Stanier also focused on refurbishing and standardising the Coach stock of the LMS and developed the Period III LMS coaches which later became known as Stanier Coaches. These designs were extremely popular and successful and many were still in service in the mid 1960's. There are many examples of Period III coaches operating on Heritage Railways throughout the UK today. The Dapol OO Model of the Stanier Coach is derived from refurbished Airfix/Mainline tooling originally purchased by Dapol in the 1980's. There are some compromises on detail accuracy due to the condition and usability of the 40+ year old tooling. However, we feel the model captures the essence of the Period III coach design well and offers an extremely affordable way of building up a fleet of pre or post nationalised fleet of LMS coaches.

The circuit includes an additional siding, providing an area where selected wagons can be deposited and collected again as the train travels the circuit. GWR Passenger Freight The train includes a 0-4-0 locomotive, two wagons and a four-wheel coach. It is operated using the R8250 train controller provided. Why choose a Hornby Analogue train set? Hornby's analogue sets represent the classic origins of Hornby's world famous model trains. In addition to track, a controller and an exquisitely detailed locomotive with carriages every Hornby set includes a Midimat (a pictorial bird's eye view of a fully sceniced layout) providing the new set owner the opportunity of seeing how by the addition of Hornby Track and Building packs a superb layout can be created. Track The track circuit sits easily on the 1600 x 1180 mm MiniMat, and by adding Hornby track and accessory packs can soon be developed into a very effective model railway layout. Extend your set in easy steps by adding track packs and TrakMat accessory packs all the way to the full layout pictured on your MidiMat. Fill out your MidiMat with additional track and building packs The track circuit in this set can be extended to fully complete the included MidiMat which, with additional Hornby Track and Building packs, can be simply and quickly built up into a truly fascinating and effective model railway layout.

I'm just a 63 year old leaner. I've always wanted a. Train set I'm into G gauge at the momentAlso 00 gauge and N gauge.  Sorry. Steve","I bought this Train set for my son and am a complete novice when it comes to Train sets.The Hornby set feels solid and attention is paid to the detail on the train. It comes with a mat, which is actually a giant printed poster. For the long term, a hard backing is needed.The track layout feels like it is the next size up from a basic layout as it already contains an extension pack.The train itself is not huge and looks silly pulling long  passenger carriages (as it would on a real train).It is quite expensive and had I not seen it at a reduced price, I probably would not have bought it (hence 4 / 5). The train can actually go quite fast in both directions. As novice I have discovered several features that must be well known to train set enthusiasts:The Trains can be tricky to get all wheels on the track. (I think there is an accessory to help with this)Big Long carriages do not like tight bends at speed (they come off).When using points to guide the train onto an inner circuit (I bought more track) you need to get jumper leads from Hornby and these are not included in Extension packs A & B.Without these the train loses power, but I think they are relatively cheap.The Track needs to be cleaned with a cloth, as any grease / dirt can stop the power to the trainTrain track has to be carefully aligned when joining one section to another, so continually putting it away and getting it out is time consuming - setting it up on a hard backing is a better solution.My child is very careful with the set and its contents, but not an ideal present for kids who leave it lying around and step on it (the carriages are expensive). I can see why people like train sets and this is a good introductory set with the plethora of accessories and trains etc from Hornby  and others we were left wanting to buy more bits and pieces (such as electric rather than manual points) after using this set.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""KNC Toys"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£65.00""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Amazon.co.uk"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£69.99""}, {""Seller_name_3""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_3""=>""£79.95""}, {""Seller_name_4""=>""Gameseek"", ""Seller_price_4""=>""£80.48""}, {""Seller_name_5""=>""CLIFFORD JAMES"", ""Seller_price_5""=>""£79.99""}, {""Seller_name_6""=>""Frome Models Centre"", ""Seller_price_6""=>""£89.99""}, {""Seller_name_7""=>""TrainStop"", ""Seller_price_7""=>""£91.99""}, {""Seller_name_8""=>""Models & Computers Plus"", ""Seller_price_8""=>""£92.99""}, {""Seller_name_9""=>""GamesQuest"", ""Seller_price_9""=>""£104.99""}]}",1

TOP 50 REVIEWER on 30 Jun. 2014 // This is a nicely-detailed HO-scale model of a Saxon Sate Railways (Epoch 1) 1st/2nd class express bogie coach - type ABBu - in the standard epoch 1 dark green livery, with a light grey roof. This is a very modern style of wooden-framed steel panelled side-corridor coach, with a steel chassis, and end-vestibule entrances and `concertina' connections for accessing other carriages. Some internal detail can be seen through the windows, such as the partitions and seating, and there are opaque-window lavatory compartments. The running number is 103.This model is fitted with the standard `loop' style of coupling. It is packaged in the current standard Piko card box with a transparent window, and a transparent plastic side-opening tray inside.This is a nicely detailed model of a high standard of manufacture, with a small packet of delicate bits for you to add. There are other models available to form a rake of these coaches.Note that I paid £37 for my model when new, so it is worth shopping around in your local model shops - or even a distant one. I live in London, but find it worth hopping on a train to Faversham in Kent to the Hobby Shop there for my models.","{""seller""=>{""Seller_name_1""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£34.95""}}",1

I needed a controller and decided that a Gaugemaster was a good choice.  As I will be building the model railway in stages I wanted something to get me started and the single track contoller was ideal.  It didn't take me long to get it conected which is simple. I found it to be very smooth and I could maintain any speed, even very slow speeds without a problem and it would just run at that speed for as long as needed.  I will in due course buy a Gaugemaster multi track controller but this is ideal for what I need at this time.  I have been using this controller for several weeks now and I am still very pleased with it. Next day free delivery! Very small, fits easily in the palm of my hand. Screw terminals for the outputs and plug in supply from the transformer input. Very smooth control of locos.Would have preferred the connections on the bottom of the unit for ease of handling.Five Stars",,1

Easy click together build. /ust built one of these! The body is self coloured in the right colour and the sides are lined out and lettered. The ends need to be painted black. Apart from the roof ventilators (which can be glued inside the roof) the whole kit clicks together ingeniously. It took about 10 mins to assemble this kit and the next will take more like 4 minutes. The only transfers/decals are the round LMS logos you can see in the centre.I don't agree with the assembly instructions! The body comprises sides ends and floor in a single piece. There is a rectangular cutout in the floor for the metal weight. I would fit the interior seat moulding into the body first. There is very little space between the compartment walls and the side of the coach to feed the flush-glaze window strips in. (They can't go in first) Particularly on the 2nd window strip I was concerned that I might overstretch the coach side at the end and make the plastic go milky. I was relieved when the glazing clicked into the windows. At that point, with the windows correctly in place, the corridor connections can be slid in the ends and the underframe offered up to the body (upside down with the metal weight located). The underframe latches actually click into the window strips to tie it all together. Likewise the roof clicks onto tabs on the window strips. Ingenious!Assembling and fitting the bogies was quite easy. The coupling retainers were fiddly though. Each coupling is plastic with a black metal hook. One of the hooks fell off. There is a C shape feature which clips onto a plastic bar and I needed to crunch it slightly with pliers, then adjust outwards with a screwdriver again until it clicked into place. The hook doesn't lift and drop as freely as it should now. It's on account of that and not being able to build the coach in the assembly instruction order (without feeling I was going to break something) that I've docked a star.","{""seller""=>[{""Seller_name_1""=>""Gaugemaster"", ""Seller_price_1""=>""£12.30""}, {""Seller_name_2""=>""Emmasaurus Shop"", ""Seller_price_2""=>""£17.25""}]}",0

Originally numbered as LNER 2595, Trigo was the eleventh of twenty-seven A3s to be built as an A3, the other fifty-one were A1s that were later converted to A3s. All the A1 and A3 Class locomotives were named after famous race horses. Trigo was an Irish born race horse who won the Epsom Derby in 1929 making the horse famous and inspiring the LNE R to name one of their new locomotives after him. Trigo is modelled here as British Rail (BR) 60084 in BR blue from the era of June 1949 to August 1952, during this period Trigo pulled a Streamline type tender and was based at the Neville Hill shed in Leeds.

Originally numbered as LNER 2595, Trigo was the eleventh of twenty-seven A3s to be built as an A3, the other fifty-one were A1s that were later converted to A3s. All the A1 and A3 Class locomotives were named after famous race horses. Trigo was an Irish born race horse who won the Epsom Derby in 1929 making the horse famous and inspiring the LNE R to name one of their new locomotives after him. Trigo is modelled here as British Rail (BR) 60084 in BR blue from the era of June 1949 to August 1952, during this period Trigo pulled a Streamline type tender and was based at the Neville Hill shed in Leeds. Sadly Trigo was withdrawn from service on the 23rd November 1964 and was later sold for scrap in January 1965.

A number of famous 'named' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels), Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923.

Completed in 2008, Tornado was the first such locomotive built in the United Kingdom since Evening Star, the last steam locomotive built by British Railways, in 1960. Designed to meet modern safety and certification standards, Tornado runs on the UK rail network and on mainline-connected heritage railways.The locomotive was built by the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust, a charitable trust founded in 1990 to build Tornado and possibly further locomotives. Tornado was conceived as an evolution of the LNER Peppercorn Class A1 class, incorporating improvements likely had steam continued, and changes for cost, safety, manufacturing and operational benefits, while replicating the original design's sound and appearance. Tornado, completely new-built, is considered the 50th Peppercorn A1, numbered next in the class after 60162, Saint Johnstoun, built in 1949.Tornado moved under her own power for the first time on 29 July 2008 at Darlington, and then spent two months at the preserved Great Central Railway double-track tourist railway in Loughborough, where she was tested up to 60 mph (97 km/h) and operated her first passenger train. Tornado then moved to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York for three test runs on the main line up to 75 mph (121 km/h). After repainting into LNER Apple Green, Tornado was approved for main-line passenger operation. On 31 January 2009 she hauled her first passenger trip on the main line, The Peppercorn Pioneer, from York to Newcastle and back. By hauling various A1 Trust railtours, charters and other activities, Tornado will begin to recoup the estimated £800,000 debt from the project, which cost around £3 million.The new Hornby model is represented in the familiar Apple Green of the early British Railways colour scheme.Young or old, keen modeller or just a beginner, the Hornby RailRoad range answers the needs of many and is a perfect complement to the variety of locomotives, rolling stock, track, buildings, and accessories that can be found in the current Hornby catalogue. Devoid of easily damaged detail parts the suitably livered RailRoad locomotives are fitted with efficient drive mechanisms and have pickups on all drive wheels ensuring smooth running. All the RailRoad models are fitted with the standard Hornby hook and bar type couplings and will therefore easily couple to those locomotives and rolling stock in both the standard Hornby and Thomas & Friends ranges. With this in mind it is easy to see that those models that make up the Hornby RailRoad range are a simple and cost effective way of adding to a train set providing a suitable and most appropriate stepping stone into the varied and fascinating World of model railways.The introductory range offers not only a selection of individual locomotives, rolling stock and accessories but an assortment of train and wagon packs ideally suited for either train set rolling stock enhancements or for those who wish to experiment and try their hands at developing their modelling techniques!This DCC Ready locomotive is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is 'DCC Ready', meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder. To convert this locomotive for use on a DCC layout one of the following digital decoder chips are required; R8245 Sapphire Decoder or R8249 V1 3 NMRA Loco Decoder.

TOP 500 REVIEWERVINE VOICE on 16 Sept. 2014 // At £50 this is a bargain and a really good set to start off a model train hobby. My 5 year old was desperate to have his own proper train set and I was concerned over getting one of the >£100 sets so this fit the bill. The track mat is a great idea and didn't take long to assemble it all.My only problem was with the controller. Everytime there was a derailment, the controller would stop working for about 1 minute, one of it's safety features. I gave up with it in the end and got a better one off the Internet. | MY NEPHEW LOVES IT // 4.0 // 9 Aug. 2013 // By

The first electric all-Pullman service in the world, it ran from 29 June 1934 till 30 April 1972.The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway was also the origin of the familiar British umber and cream Pullman livery. In 1903 Billinton changed the colour of the ordinary L.B. & S.C.R. coaches to umber brown with white or cream upper panels, and in 1906 this colour scheme was also adopted by the Pullman Car Co., with the name of the car in large gilt letters on the lower panel and flanked on each side by a coloured transfer of the Pullman Company's crest.Another all-Pullman service was introduced in 1908 under the name of the Southern Belle. Contemporary advertising by the L.B. & S.C.R. claimed that this was ""... the most luxurious train in the world..."". In 1908 this could be experienced for a special London Victoria to Brighton day return fare of 12 shillings, a premium rate at a time when average earnings were around £1 a week. The Southern Belle was steam hauled until 1933, when electric units were introduced. With the arrival of the mid-day Victoria to Brighton service at Brighton Station on 29 June 1934, the Mayor of Brighton, Miss M. Hardy, renamed the train the Brighton Belle, and it retained this title until withdrawal.The stunningly elegant Hornby model initially produced in two distinctive livery periods captures perfectly the opulence and style of the Brighton Belle Pullman. Each Car is lit and complete with detailed interior.This DCC Ready car pack is compatible with analogue train layouts, but can easily be converted for use on a DCC (digital) layout. This loco is 'DCC Ready', meaning they feature a special socket ready to receive a DCC Decoder.

The Southern Railway (SR) was established in 1923, linking London with the Channel ports, South West England, South coast resorts in Kent. It was the smallest of the 'Big Four' railway regions with most of it's revenue coming from passenger traffic rather than freight in the more densely populated region of southern England. A number of famous 'named' trains were operated by SR including the Brighton Belle, Bournemouth Belle, Golden Arrow, the Night Ferry (London - Paris and Brussels), Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle. Both Richard Maunsell and Oliver Bulleid served as Chief Mechanical Engineers to the SR between 1923 and 1948 and both designed new locomotives and rolling stock to replace those inherited in 1923. The electrification of the region began in 1929 under the management of Sir Herbert Walker. On completion it was the world's largest electrified railway system. The steel panelled wooden framed bodied were built at SR Eastleigh Works and the steel underframes at SR Lancing Works. Each 2 car unit measured 129ft 6in long and 9ft 2in, wide and were powered by two English Electric traction motors of 275hp (205kW) with a maximum speed of 60mph. The units were fitted with automatic air-brakes The 2-BILs weighed 74tons 15cwt and had a passenger capacity of 24 in the First Class and 84 or 88 Third Class area. The remaining units stayed in service and passed to the newly formed British Railways in 1948 where they were re-classified as Class 401 and continued in service on BR Southern Region but by 1971 all the units have been withdrawn.

Originally numbered 4498, Sir Nigel Gresley was due to receive the name Bittern, before the realisation of its commemorative status. As with the earlier LNER A4 Pacifics, it was built with a single chimney and side valances covering the wheels which were later removed to improve maintenance access. Sir Nigel Gresley carries a commemorative plaque as the holder of the post-war steam speed record reaching 112mph in May 1959. As with the Mallardâ€™s record this was achieved descending southward from Stoke Summit, but unlike the Mallardâ€™s special attempt this was with a full train of passengers returning from an excursion. As with other A4s, Sir Nigel Gresley has worn many liveries throughout its career. When released to traffic in October 1937 it carried the standard LNER garter blue of the A4 Pacifics and has since carried various liveries. Sir Nigel Gresley, now bearing the British Railways number 60007 with a British Railways blue livery, was saved from scrapping in 1966 by a small group of men who set up the â€˜A4 Preservation Societyâ€™, later known as â€˜The A4 Locomotive Society Ltdâ€™ and now â€˜The Sir Nigel Gresley Locomotive Preservation Trust Ltdâ€™. â€˜The A4 Locomotive Societyâ€™ has since become the subsidiary company that operates the locomotive for the Trust.

From 1953 to 1962, 996 locomotives were produced, making it the most numerous of all British locomotive classes. As the standard general-purpose diesel shunter on BR, almost any duty requiring shunting would involve a Class 08. The class became a familiar sight at many major stations and freight yards. However, since their introduction, the nature of rail traffic in Britain has changed considerably. Freight trains are now mostly fixed rakes of wagons and passenger trains are mostly multiple units, neither requiring the attention of a shunting locomotive. Consequently, a large proportion of the class has been withdrawn from mainline use and stored, scrapped, exported or sold to industrial or heritage railways.As of 2011, around 100 locomotives remain working on industrial sidings and on the main British network. On heritage railways, they have become common, appearing on many of the preserved standard-gauge lines in Britain, with over 60 preserved.Digital control (DCC) has many advantages over the conventional DC control, however arguably the most dramatic bonus of operating DCC must be the advantages of Operating locomotives fitted with sound. How wonderfully alive can a layout become when sound can be heard from the locomotives? The more modern locomotives such as the Class 60, 56, 31 and even the ubiquitous 08, each of these classes have their own individual sound and are ready to play their part in adding audible realism to any DCC operated layout.

H. Peppercorn took advantage of Thompson's retirement in 1946 to develop the design into the K1 Class. The K1 Class, which was made up of 70 locomotives, were all built in Glasgow at the North British Locomotive Company's Park Works over a 10 month period between May 1949 and March 1950. As was the North British Locomotive Company's all of the Class were sent to Eastfield shed, Glasgow for running in before being sent to England where they were used for both freight and express passenger workings. Thirty of the Class were sent to the Eastern Region while the remaining forty were dispatched to the North Eastern Region. Many of the North Eastern K1s were often seen as far North as Edinburgh and early on in their working life were regularly used on the West Highland line. A significant number of those allocated to the Eastern Region were based at March. All of the Class were fitted with electric lighting and self-cleaning smoke boxes identified with an SC plate situated just beneath the shed plate while some were fitted with AWS (Automatic Warning System). The first 50 K1 locomotives were outshopped in black with ""British Railways"" emblazoned on the tender while the remaining twenty were released with the early BR crest. From 1957 all of the Class received the BR emblem. As described the Class were used throughout the former LNER network as they were proven to be an incredible mixed traffic locomotive with each of the Class being paired with a 4200 gallon tender as used with the LNER/BR Class B1 locomotive. By 1958 the K1s were starting to be transferred from the Great Eastern Region with the result that by 1961 only eight remained at March, however by the middle of 1962 these had been moved to Retford and Doncaster. Withdrawal of the K1s began in December 1962 but it was a very slow demise as it took a full five years before the last locomotive, which was 62005 was withdrawn from service on the Eastern Region in 1967. Luckily 62005 survived into preservation and can be seen operating at the time of writing on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. K1 Class locomotive number 62059 was outshopped from the North British on the 13 December 1949. By 1950 the locomotive was on shed at 51G Haverton Hill where it remained until 1957 when 62059 could be seen on shed Ardsley and then later that year, Darlington. By March 1960 the locomotive was transferred to 51J Northallerton but was returned to Darlington in August of that same year. In February 1966, 62059 was rostered to 52F, Blyth (North) where it remained until withdrawal in February 1967. Locomotive BR Class K1 62059 was sold for scrap in April 1967 to Hughes Bolckow, Blyth where later that year the locomotive was cut up.
